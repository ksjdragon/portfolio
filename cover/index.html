						To whom it may concern,<br><br>
						My name is Kenneth Jao. My interests and expertise lie in both software and hardware design, supported by all relevant underlying mathematics. With experience in both front-end user interface design, implementing optimized and secure back-end algorithms, as well as an understanding of Unix system administration, I believe I would be a valuable asset to your software development team.
						<br><br>
						In my 6 years of programming experience, I have worked with several others on projects. We created a web application, Hourglass, to help students organize schoolwork collectively and more efficiently. Besides programming itself, I have taken the role of a project leader. I organize and structure the environment and requirements, to keep the workflow as smooth as possible. By having experienced the importance of standardization and documentation for projects, I believe I will easily adapt to far larger projects in the field, no matter what your team may be working on.
						<br><br>
						With regards to programming, I also have the following skills:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Abstraction for object oriented programming</li>
						<li>Developing algorithms for mathematical concepts</li>
						<li>Understanding of network structures</li>
						<li>Data analysis and aggregation through scripting and scraping</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					<p>
						Most importantly, I am confident in my ability to work with others in a high-paced environment, and will be a positive impact in the work that is done. Thank you for your time for reviewing my application among hundreds of others. I look forward to your response.
						<br><br>

						Sincerely,<br>
						Kenneth Jao
